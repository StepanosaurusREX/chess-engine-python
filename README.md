CHESS - Engine (Python)
====================================
Introduction
------------------------------------
After a year and a half of working as a junior software developer, I’ve decided it’s time to shake things up with some personal projects and dive into new technologies just for fun. Finishing my degree left me feeling a bit overwhelmed, and I didn’t get much chance to play around with new ideas. Now, I’m excited to break free from that grind and explore cool projects, experiment with different tech, and really have some fun with what I’ve learned! (July 2024)

This is an engine for game of chess written in Python. This is personal project of [StepanosaurusREX](https://github.com/StepanosaurusREX) and its sole purpose is to have fun and to learn. Use of this code in closed source projects is prohibited.
